The differently abled is a large spectrum of several categories which may include cerebral palsy, mental retardation, orthopaedic disabilities, deaf, dump or with multiple disabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>What are the problems faced by these children?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >The whole category of differently abled children is grown with very a low self-esteem and they find themselves in a difficult state to build confidence from a very young age. The first rejection came from their own parents, who cannot accept the condition into which their children are born into. Of course, parents do have their own expectation about how their children may look like or what he may do or even about what he should become. Often such parents may end up in taking care of their children without accepting the disabilities he does have which may cause severe psychological implications on children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>The golden thousand days<o:p></o:p></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >Only if the parent accepts the fact of disability, the door of treatment opens before their children. But parents often use a defensive mechanism to reject this fact and in a way, deny several treatments that the child should be receiving. If you can start treatment on the first thousand days of a child, when most of the disabilities can be identified, many disabilities like body distortions or brain damage can be reverted. From that point of time, if parents can start treatments with an acknowledgement that his child is different, we can make him grow into a comparatively normal condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>Physical rejections<o:p></o:p></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >Many times children with disabilities are grown with rejections in different parts of their life and he will revert it back to the society. Even a normal kid would have done the same, but a child with disabilities also have a potential to get violent in such situations. He will not be able to accept the people around. Due to such behaviours, parents often lock them inside a house and would never consider taking him outside. They are heavily separated from the mainstream society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>A problem with the wealthy<o:p></o:p></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >Children with disabilities born to wealthy parents also face some peculiar challenges. Such children are often gifted with advanced infrastructure facilities, drivers, and servants while denying love, which they desperately need. They want to communicate, meet more people and travel which we often reject them from. They are often tried to fix into routine or system which they may refuse to accept violently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>Psychological rejections<o:p></o:p></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >Most of the problems that differently abled children face are rooted from the psychological rejections they face rather than the physical ones. The things we speak have a definite influence on these children and it amplifies the problems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>The government<o:p></o:p></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >The government of Kerala is educating 20 lakh ‘so-called’ normal children in their schools whereas 8.5 lakh differently abled children are left with no consideration. On 14 November during the celebrations of Children’s day, the government gives them a treat provided with milk and banana, but through all these years and with all these schools they are never been invited to be educated.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a name=\"_GoBack\"></a><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>', '1'),

Sri K Suresh Kurup MLA and Shri Jose K Mani were the chief guests of the function.

Sri K Rupesh Kumar, coordinator, State Responsible Tourism Mission announced the new Responsible tourism destinations.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Welcoming the gathering, Dr Venu V IAS Principal Secretary Kerala Tourism said that It’s a proud moment for all of us. Responsible Tourism that started off in Kumarakom is now a world-renowned concept and a point of discussion across the globe. It’s definitely a proud moment for us to be a pioneer in setting up this concept so effectively. Within a span of 9 years, 16 crores is the profit Kumarakom could gain through tourism. Around 1.16 crore revenue is generated by the localities. The reason behind this growth is the involvement as a group by the communities around. The aim of RT is to create 1.5 lakh jobs in the future, said Dr Venu V.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Presiding over the function, Sri Kadakampally Surendran, Honorable Minister of Tourism, said, to be the pioneer state in practising the concept of Responsible Tourism in the entire country is a proud moment. The government policy is to make Tourism more popular. Apart from improving the functioning of the elite class, the government also aims to use tourism as a tool for village development and women empowerment. Their aim is to make Responsible Tourism more beneficial to the localities. It feels proud to see the mission that started off in Kumarakom as a pilot project in 2008 and is very happy and proud about this. The Government moves forward aiming to bring in more job opportunities and income generation to the localities”</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Inaugurating the Responsible Tourism Mission of the state, Speaking on the occasion, Honorable Chief Minister- Pinarayi Vijayan said, “Waste management should be a prime consideration in any development program. The tourist spots and places around the state should be kept clean at all times without asking for an additional cost. It should be a practice by itself. The tourism department should make enough arrangements to accommodate than the number of tourists coming into the state. One needs to appreciate Responsible Tourism completely for it is a source of support for the local communities. Our land is encompassed by serenity and greenery. That is why it\'s called God’s own country. Hence, more attention given to Tourism wing will only prove to be beneficial for the development of the state. There are a lot of countries around the world who has made the profit through tourism. Hence, the same level of importance should be given here. The people who come in as tourists are financially sound in many ways. However, it\'s not the financially sound people who walk in as tourists, there are a lot of people within our state who are tourists. Most of the tourists in our state are largely common and middle-class people. However, these people who hail from our state as tourists should not be exploited said Honorable Chief Minister Sri Pinarayi Vijayan. However, in today’s world, mentalities and approaches have changed slowly.  People abroad buy products from the manufacturing place itself thereby paying huge amounts for it. Hence, in order to sell these products, we have to ensure proper arrangements. We have to consider these tourists as our guests and we have to treat them well off and for this, the society will have to pay attention and equally contribute to this development. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">With a bunch of new projects under the new mission, the state aims at expanding Responsible Tourism across the state by incorporating a set of new destinations. Currently, it is carried out only in seven destinations in the state, viz. Kumarakom, Thekkady, Vythiri, Ambalavayal, Kumbalangi, Bakel and Kovalam. Kerala has bagged countless national and international awards and recognition for these projects. Sri Kadakampally Surendran, Minister for Tourism, Government of Kerala, bagged six National Tourism Awards 2015-16 from The President Shri Ram Nath Kovind, Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi out of which one was credited for the Best Responsible Tourism Initiative for ‘Kumarakom’.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Shri P Bala Kiran IAS, Director of Kerala Tourism gave a deep insight into the Responsible Tourism mission project. 1”4 districts across the state have initiated Responsible Tourism cells. The state RT cell has been formed and has already kick-started with its functioning and as part of this, from 6 destinations, today we have almost 35 destinations on RT across Kerala\", said Bala Kiran IAS, Director of Tourism, Kerala.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Turning these baby steps into big leaps, the Mission takes Responsible Tourism to all 14 districts. The government plans to create 1,50,000 employment opportunities in the tourism sector alone through the Responsible Tourism Mission, in a span of 5 years. The selected destinations for the Responsible Tourism plan are mostly areas that are covered by backwater, sea, wildlife, heritage and diversity in areas comprising natural beauty. The scheme is being implemented with the primary objective of ensuring extra income and livelihood for agricultural labourers, traditional industrial workers and marginalized communities in these areas and to give equal importance to the social-environmental parity.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Vocational training will be provided to at least 50,000 local natives.  This year, as a part of Responsible Tourism, at least 20 Village Life Experience Packages will be opened. It has been proven that Village tourism packages attract a lot of tourists because of the conventional experience of rope-making, handloom, earthenware and toddy tapping in these packages. This project will take the responsibility of ensuring more ways of income to the local community by means of keeping traditional jobs, handicraft activities and classical art forms as part of tourism. The next 4 years will focus on the formation of widespread workshops, tourism planning with popular participation and much more.</span></p>', '1'),

Most of the schools have the arrangement for a traditionally dressed king-like figure to reach every student in the school. This is a reminder for the story and values he shares.

Instead\r\nof banning and evoking unnecessary interest and curiosity, these gadgets can be\r\nused as tools for education, moving with the times. There are certain schools\r\nin India which have adopted different curriculum, mostly international, where\r\nthe children of the privileged class only can study.

He was\r\nextremely happy to read that letter but was amused by their request to have an\r\nIndian elephant in a zoo of their country. It was not because they never had an\r\nelephant that the children want to see, but because the elephants they so loved\r\nwere killed during the second world war. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A 15-year old female elephant called Indira -named after his daughter- was immediately sent to Japan as a\r\ngift to the children of that country. And so was his love to children that he\r\nwrote a letter addressing them and presenting the elephant as a gift from\r\nchildren of his country.

Sometimes\r\nlistening to others I feel that I must be wise and brilliant and important.\r\nThen, looking at myself, I begin to doubt this.
