All the pots are eco-friendly, while the composts are made by natural methods like biogas, vermin and bin composts here itself.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" ><b>Nurturing the habit of green<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" >The habit of farming or gardening must be started from the school level as this can help in creating a greener nature for next generation rather than of plastic. Gardening will help to build a meaningful relationship between life and nature. In schools, this can be a part of extracurricular activities, projects and assignments. The children will understand the process of plant development; with which the students will be able to evaluate the importance of life in every living being. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" >It is important to teach the next generation how to manage the nature and the life with it. The only healthy way of farming is organic. Use of pesticides and insecticides are widely seen in the present agricultural industry and the vegetables we buy from the markets are mostly contaminated. All my plants have a yellow tag with applied Neem oil so that the insects are attracted to it and will not damage the plant. <o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" ><b>Role of schools and parents<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" >Waste management or trash disposal should be a part of our behaviour for which the schools and parents can play a vital role. The children should be trained about how to dispose the waste and should be taught how to maintain the public place clean. From their tender age itself, the habit of leaving the waste into a dustbin instead of throwing it in roads or public places should be inculcated as a culture.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" ><b>Filtering and reusing water<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" >The technique of aquaponics is used for filtering the fish tank water. Water from the fish tank will be pumped into a tub with plants, stones and other filtering substances. The excreta of fish is used as a fertiliser for plants; whereas the water gets filtered and flows back to the fish tank.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" ><b>Upcycling<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" >When it comes to pampering the nature; I believe in using only nature-friendly substances like stones, bamboo stakes, old broken woods etc. Water retaining is an important matter in maintaining the garden and for this, I have used the small stones for making paths. Upcycling old substances like coconut shell into pots, broken pieces of cartwheel into name board and use of old glass jars for close terrarium etc. helps to keep the garden more eco-friendly.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" ><b>Keeping the public property clean<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" >The major problem in our country is that people are very insensitive of their trash. They are worried only about disposing of their household waste from their area or vicinity and are least bothered about whether it\u2019s thrown to another\u2019s property.

It was the differently abled children that I found heavily disadvantaged and started to serve them from 2011 with the inception of&nbsp;CEFEE. While studying in Hyderabad I had such experiences in social works, which may have intrigued me to do such works.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>Why we really need an institution for differently abled children?<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >Though the central government does have a department for the persons with disabilities, the state government of Kerala doesn't have a separate body, but only under the social justice department with many other sections take care of disabled. Differently abled children are often left unnoticed and are disadvantaged during the allocation of funds due to several such reasons.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >In our programs, we minimize the number of speeches and keep an extra vigil to indulge with them because what they need the most is the love to remove the rejections that they have faced in their life. You won't often see differently-abled children on streets and are kept out of public spaces, which shouldn\u2019t make them foreign to democratic rights. They are in real need for a community to bring them under a single umbrella while the blind already had such federations in both central and state level.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>Can you define the \u2018differently abled\u2019 children that you deal with?<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >By children, I don't mean under-18 because their mental age may differ from that of the physical age. So, when I say children this may also include a person of physical age 45&nbsp;and his mental age could be around 8-9. The differently abled is a large spectrum of several categories which may include cerebral palsy, mental retardation, orthopaedic disabilities, deaf, dump or with multiple disabilities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>What are the problems faced by these children?<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >The whole category of differently abled children is grown with very a low self-esteem and they find themselves in a difficult state to build confidence from a very young age. The first rejection came from their own parents, who cannot accept the condition into which their children are born into. Of course, parents do have their own expectation about how their children may look like or what he may do or even about what he should become. Often such parents may end up in taking care of their children without accepting the disabilities he does have which may cause severe psychological implications on children.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>The golden thousand days<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >Only if the parent accepts the fact of disability, the door of treatment opens before their children. But parents often use a defensive mechanism to reject this fact and in a way, deny several treatments that the child should be receiving. If you can start treatment on the first thousand days of a child, when most of the disabilities can be identified, many disabilities like body distortions or brain damage can be reverted. From that point of time, if parents can start treatments with an acknowledgement that his child is different, we can make him grow into a comparatively normal condition.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>Physical rejections<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >Many times children with disabilities are grown with rejections in different parts of their life and he will revert it back to the society. Even a normal kid would have done the same, but a child with disabilities also have a potential to get violent in such situations. He will not be able to accept the people around. Due to such behaviours, parents often lock them inside a house and would never consider taking him outside. They are heavily separated from the mainstream society.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>A problem with the wealthy<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >Children with disabilities born to wealthy parents also face some peculiar challenges. Such children are often gifted with advanced infrastructure facilities, drivers, and servants while denying love, which they desperately need. They want to communicate, meet more people and travel which we often reject them from. They are often tried to fix into routine or system which they may refuse to accept violently.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>Psychological rejections<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >Most of the problems that differently abled children face are rooted from the psychological rejections they face rather than the physical ones. The things we speak have a definite influence on these children and it amplifies the problems.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><b>The government<o:p><\/o:p><\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" >The government of Kerala is educating 20 lakh \u2018so-called\u2019 normal children in their schools whereas 8.5 lakh differently abled children are left with no consideration. On 14 November during the celebrations of Children\u2019s day, the government gives them a treat provided with milk and banana, but through all these years and with all these schools they are never been invited to be educated.<o:p><\/o:p><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a name=\"_GoBack\"><\/a><o:p>&nbsp;<\/o:p><\/p>","astatus":"1"},

The world's first Responsible Tourism Mission is all set to lead Kerala Tourism through people-friendly, local community-friendly and environment-friendly, initiatives ensuring rural development, employment opportunities and women empowerment.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Sri Kadakampally Surendran, Minister of Tourism, presided over the function. Sri K Suresh Kurup MLA and Shri Jose K Mani were the chief guests of the function. Dr Venu V, IAS, Principal Secretary, Kerala tourism delivered the welcome speech and P Bala Kiran, IAS, Director of Tourism presented the Responsible Tourism Mission project. Sri K Rupesh Kumar, coordinator, State Responsible Tourism Mission announced the new Responsible tourism destinations.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Welcoming the gathering, Dr Venu V IAS Principal Secretary Kerala Tourism said that It\u2019s a proud moment for all of us. Responsible Tourism that started off in Kumarakom is now a world-renowned concept and a point of discussion across the globe. It\u2019s definitely a proud moment for us to be a pioneer in setting up this concept so effectively. Within a span of 9 years, 16 crores is the profit Kumarakom could gain through tourism. Around 1.16 crore revenue is generated by the localities. The reason behind this growth is the involvement as a group by the communities around. The aim of RT is to create 1.5 lakh jobs in the future, said Dr Venu V.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Presiding over the function, Sri Kadakampally Surendran, Honorable Minister of Tourism, said, to be the pioneer state in practising the concept of Responsible Tourism in the entire country is a proud moment. The government policy is to make Tourism more popular. Apart from improving the functioning of the elite class, the government also aims to use tourism as a tool for village development and women empowerment. Their aim is to make Responsible Tourism more beneficial to the localities. It feels proud to see the mission that started off in Kumarakom as a pilot project in 2008 and is very happy and proud about this. The Government moves forward aiming to bring in more job opportunities and income generation to the localities\u201d<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Inaugurating the Responsible Tourism Mission of the state, Speaking on the occasion, Honorable Chief Minister- Pinarayi Vijayan said, \u201cWaste management should be a prime consideration in any development program. The tourist spots and places around the state should be kept clean at all times without asking for an additional cost. It should be a practice by itself. The tourism department should make enough arrangements to accommodate than the number of tourists coming into the state. One needs to appreciate Responsible Tourism completely for it is a source of support for the local communities. Our land is encompassed by serenity and greenery. That is why it's called God\u2019s own country. Hence, more attention given to Tourism wing will only prove to be beneficial for the development of the state. There are a lot of countries around the world who has made the profit through tourism. Hence, the same level of importance should be given here. The people who come in as tourists are financially sound in many ways. However, it's not the financially sound people who walk in as tourists, there are a lot of people within our state who are tourists. Most of the tourists in our state are largely common and middle-class people. However, these people who hail from our state as tourists should not be exploited said Honorable Chief Minister Sri Pinarayi Vijayan. However, in today\u2019s world, mentalities and approaches have changed slowly.\u00a0 People abroad buy products from the manufacturing place itself thereby paying huge amounts for it. Hence, in order to sell these products, we have to ensure proper arrangements. We have to consider these tourists as our guests and we have to treat them well off and for this, the society will have to pay attention and equally contribute to this development.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">With a bunch of new projects under the new mission, the state aims at expanding Responsible Tourism across the state by incorporating a set of new destinations. Currently, it is carried out only in seven destinations in the state, viz. Kumarakom, Thekkady, Vythiri, Ambalavayal, Kumbalangi, Bakel and Kovalam. Kerala has bagged countless national and international awards and recognition for these projects. Sri Kadakampally Surendran, Minister for Tourism, Government of Kerala, bagged six National Tourism Awards 2015-16 from The President Shri Ram Nath Kovind, Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi out of which one was credited for the Best Responsible Tourism Initiative for \u2018Kumarakom\u2019.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Shri P Bala Kiran IAS, Director of Kerala Tourism gave a deep insight into the Responsible Tourism mission project. 1\u201d4 districts across the state have initiated Responsible Tourism cells. The state RT cell has been formed and has already kick-started with its functioning and as part of this, from 6 destinations, today we have almost 35 destinations on RT across Kerala\", said Bala Kiran IAS, Director of Tourism, Kerala.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Turning these baby steps into big leaps, the Mission takes Responsible Tourism to all 14 districts. The government plans to create 1,50,000 employment opportunities in the tourism sector alone through the Responsible Tourism Mission, in a span of 5 years. The selected destinations for the Responsible Tourism plan are mostly areas that are covered by backwater, sea, wildlife, heritage and diversity in areas comprising natural beauty. The scheme is being implemented with the primary objective of ensuring extra income and livelihood for agricultural labourers, traditional industrial workers and marginalized communities in these areas and to give equal importance to the social-environmental parity.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" ><span lang=\"EN-US\">Vocational training will be provided to at least 50,000 local natives.\u00a0 This year, as a part of Responsible Tourism, at least 20 Village Life Experience Packages will be opened. It has been proven that Village tourism packages attract a lot of tourists because of the conventional experience of rope-making, handloom, earthenware and toddy tapping in these packages. This project will take the responsibility of ensuring more ways of income to the local community by means of keeping traditional jobs, handicraft activities and classical art forms as part of tourism. The next 4 years will focus on the formation of widespread workshops, tourism planning with popular participation and much more.<\/span><\/p>","astatus":"1"},

This November, 'The Daybreak' is rediscovering his affection to children through an unusual gift and a letter he wrote that proves his passion for writing letters.  ","author":"Libin Chacko Kurian ","useremail":"","date":"2017-11-14","article":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jawaharlal Nehru loved the art of writing letters especially, for\r\nchildren. He used to find time even in his busy schedule to read, write and\r\nreply to the letters that he had received every day.\r\nThe letters he wrote to his daughter, Indira, while still he was in jail during\r\nthe freedom struggle later became very\r\nfamous and are popular even today in form of a book, due to the wisdom he\r\nexpressed in those.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On October 2, 1949, Nehru was having his usual time in reading the\r\nletters that he received on that particular day\r\nuntil he was stumbled upon a letter written by some children in Japan. He was\r\nextremely happy to read that letter but was amused by their request to have an\r\nIndian elephant in a zoo of their country. It was not because they never had an\r\nelephant that the children want to see, but because the elephants they so loved\r\nwere killed during the second world war. <o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A 15-year old female elephant called Indira -named after his daughter- was immediately sent to Japan as a\r\ngift to the children of that country. And so was his love to children that he\r\nwrote a letter addressing them and presenting the elephant as a gift from\r\nchildren of his country. For 34 years, Indira\r\nlived in Japan and cherished the lives of Japanese children before she died in\r\n1983.&nbsp; <o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Just two months after this incident, Nehru had to write another letter,\r\nthis time to the children of his own country, when K Shankar Pillai, the father\r\nof political cartooning in India, started competitions for children, which was\r\naddressed through his publication. The letter which brings out Nehru's endless\r\nfeeling towards children and his extraordinary wisdom about the world we are\r\nliving in also talks about the Japanese\r\nincident and his vision about how children should grow up. <o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">What better to read on Children's Day than the words of Chacha-Ji himself, that even a letter to children,\r\nparticularly.<o:p><\/o:p><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Dear Children,<o:p><\/o:p><\/i><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>I like being\r\nwith children and talking to them and, even more, playing with them. For the\r\nmoment I forget that I am terribly old and it is very long ago since I was a\r\nchild. But when I sit down to write, I cannot forget my age and the distance that\r\nseparates you from me. Old people have a habit of delivering sermons and good\r\nadvice to the young.<o:p><\/o:p><\/i><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>I remember that I disliked this very much long ago when I was a boy. So\r\nI suppose you do not like it very much either. Grown-ups also have a habit of\r\nappearing to be very wise, even though very few of them possess much wisdom. I\r\nhave not yet quite made up my mind whether I am wise or not. Sometimes\r\nlistening to others I feel that I must be wise and brilliant and important.\r\nThen, looking at myself, I begin to doubt this. In any event, people who are\r\nwise do not talk about their wisdom and do not behave as if they were very\r\nsuperior persons...<o:p><\/o:p><\/i><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>What then shall I write about? If you were with me, I would love to talk\r\nto you about this beautiful world of ours, about flowers, trees, birds,\r\nanimals, stars, mountains, glaciers and all the other beautiful things that\r\nsurround us in the world. We have all this beauty all around us and yet we, who\r\nare grown-ups, often forget about it and lose ourselves in our arguments or in\r\nour quarrels. We sit in our offices and imagine that we are doing very\r\nimportant work. <o:p><\/o:p><\/i><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span>I hope you will be more sensible and open your eyes\r\nand ears to this beauty and life that surrounds you. Can you recognise the\r\nflowers by their names and the birds by their singing? How easy it is to make\r\nfriends with them and with everything in nature\r\nif you go to them affectionately and with friendship. You must have read many\r\nfairy tales and stories of long ago. But the world itself is the greatest fairy\r\ntale and story of adventure that was ever written. Only we must have eyes to\r\nsee and ears to hear and a mind that opens out to the life and beauty of the\r\nworld.<\/span> <o:p><\/o:p><\/i><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span>Grown-ups have a strange way of putting themselves\r\nin compartments and groups. They build barriers... of religion, caste, colour,\r\nparty, nation, province, language, customs and of rich and poor. Thus they live\r\nin prisons of their own making. Fortunately, children do not know much about\r\nthese barriers, which separate. They play and work with each other and it is\r\nonly when they grow up that they begin to learn about these barriers from their\r\nelders. I hope you will take a long time in growing up...<\/span> <o:p><\/o:p><\/i><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span>Some months ago, the children of Japan wrote to me\r\nand asked me to send them an elephant. I sent them a beautiful elephant on\r\nbehalf of the children of India... This noble animal became a symbol of India\r\nto them and a link between them and the children of India. I was very happy\r\nthat this gift of ours gave so much joy to so many children of Japan, and made\r\nthem think of our country... remember that everywhere there are children like\r\nyou going to school and work and play, and sometimes quarrelling but always\r\nmaking friends again. You can read about these countries in your books, and\r\nwhen you grow up many of you will visit them. Go there as friends and you will\r\nfind friends to greet you.<\/span><o:p><\/o:p><\/i><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><i>You know we had a very great man amongst us. He was\r\ncalled Mahatma Gandhi. But we used to call him affectionately Bapuji. He was\r\nwise, but he did not show off his wisdom.

The award committee also appreciated the works of the organization to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons.\u00a0Setsuko Thurlow, the 85-year-old survivor of 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima will jointly accept the Prize together with ICAN\u2019s executive director, Beatrice Fihn, at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo on 10 December.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2017: Richard H. Thaler<\/b><\/p><p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded this year's Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences to Richard H. Thaler for his contributions while incorporating economics and psychology. He integrated psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. By exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control, he has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes.<\/p><p>Thaler is a professor at the University of Chicago and the director of the Center for Decision Research and is the co-director of the Behavioral Economics Project at the National Bureau of Economic Research.\u00a0Thaler is the co-author of the global bestseller Nudge in which the concepts of behavioural economics are used to tackle many of society\u2019s major problems. In 2015 he published Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics.<\/p><p><b>The Nobel Prize in Literature 2017: Kazuo Ishiguro<\/b><\/p><p>The Japanese-born British author, Kazuo Ishiguro, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, to quote the Swedish Academy,\"who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world\".\u00a0As one of the most celebrated English fiction writer in the contemporary world, Kazuo had admitted several times that his Japanese background helped him to look at things in a different perspective.\u00a0He is the author of Man Booker Prize-winning novel, The Remains of the Day, and his novel, Never Let Me Go, was selected by Time magazine as the best of 2005.\u00a0<\/p><p><b>The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2017: Jeffrey C.

Young<\/b><\/p><p>Acknowledging the glory of their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm, The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine jointly to Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young.\u00a0<\/p><p>Do you know that living organisms, including humans, have an internal, biological clock that helps them anticipate and adapt to the regular rhythm of the day or the revolutions of our planet? The new Nobel winning trio was able to peek inside these biological clocks and find out its inner workings. Their discoveries explain how plants, animals and humans adapt their biological rhythm so that it is synchronized with the Earth's revolutions.\u00a0They have isolated a gene of fruit flies that controls their normal daily biological rhythm and showed that this gene encodes a protein that accumulates in the cell during the night, and is then degraded during the day. Our wellbeing is affected when there is a temporary mismatch between our external environment and this internal biological clock, for example when we travel across several time zones and experience \"jet lag\".\u00a0<\/p><p>Michael Rosbash has been on faculty at Brandeis University in Waltham, USA, since 1974.
